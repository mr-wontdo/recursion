# Recursion
Javascript solutions to The Odin Project's Recursion problems: fibonacci and merge sort.

## Assignment 1
1. Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
2. Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

## Assignment 2
1. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].
